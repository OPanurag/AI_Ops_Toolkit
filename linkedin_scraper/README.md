# 🧠 LinkedIn Profile Scraper (Educational Use Only)
```
A simple **Selenium-based LinkedIn profile scraper** built for educational and testing purposes.  
It automates Chrome using Selenium, extracts profile data from given LinkedIn URLs, and saves the results into a CSV file incrementally.
```
---

## 🚀 Features

- Reads LinkedIn profile URLs from `urls.txt`
- Logs into LinkedIn using a test account (optional)
- Opens each profile in a headless Chrome browser
- Extracts:
  - Name  
  - Headline  
  - Location  
  - About section
- Saves results **incrementally** to `output/linkedin_profiles.csv`  
- Handles failures gracefully — any broken links or timeouts are logged with `"ERROR"`

## ▶️ Usage

### Step 1: Add Profile URLs

Create a file named `urls.txt` in the `linkedin_scraper` folder and add one LinkedIn profile URL per line:

```
https://www.linkedin.com/in/sundar-pichai
https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella
https://www.linkedin.com/in/arvindkrishna
```

### Step 2: Run the Scraper

Execute this command from the **project root**:

```bash
python linkedin_scraper/linkedin_scraper.py
```

This will:

* Launch a headless Chrome browser
* Optionally log into LinkedIn using your provided test credentials
* Scrape each profile in sequence
* Save extracted data incrementally into `output/linkedin_profiles.csv`

---

## 🧾 Output Format

The scraper saves output in CSV format with the following columns:

| url | name | headline | location | about |
| --- | ---- | -------- | -------- | ----- |

Example output:

```
https://www.linkedin.com/in/sundar-pichai, Sundar Pichai, CEO at Google, California, United States, Passionate about building useful technology.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella, Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO at Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, Focused on AI and innovation.
```

## ⚡ Key Highlights

* **Incremental Writing:** Each profile’s data is appended immediately after extraction (no data loss even if interrupted).
* **Headless Mode:** Default setting allows scraping without opening a browser window.
* **Lightweight & Safe:** Uses official ChromeDriver via `webdriver-manager`, ensuring compatibility with your installed Chrome version.
* **Extensible:** You can modify selectors in `extract_fields_from_html()` to capture more data like experience, education, etc.

---

## 🧠 Technical Notes

* Fake user agents are **optional** — this script already includes a real Chrome user agent for safe execution.
* For large-scale or production scraping, use **LinkedIn’s official APIs** or **Sales Navigator Export**, as scraping may violate LinkedIn’s Terms of Service.
* Always use a **test or dummy LinkedIn account**.

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

**1. Chrome not found error:**
Check that Chrome is installed and accessible at
`/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome` (macOS).
For Linux or Windows, update the `webdriver-manager` installation automatically.

**2. Login not working:**
Ensure that the `EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` constants in the script are updated with valid **test credentials**.

**3. CAPTCHA or access denied:**
LinkedIn may block automated requests. Add random delays or switch to manual login once.
